# JS Calculator

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/vanbc18/pen/XWzBLMX](https://codepen.io/vanbc18/pen/XWzBLMX).

This was a very interesting project. I used a lot of vanilla JS, it was nice to go through the logic of a calculator app.
Using the eval() function was a big help to achieve this app. I used React to render the calculator, and Bootstrap to make it responsive and style it.
